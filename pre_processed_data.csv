axial fans accessories representatives dc centrifugal fans ac centrifugal fans types of fans and their function axial fans high air flow with medium to relatively high pressure build up the air flow in axial fans whose impeller is similar to that of a propeller is conducted to a great extent parallel to the axis of rotation in other words in the axial direction axial fans with free air delivery at zero static pressure have the lowest power input that rises with increasing back pressure axial fans for cooling of electronic equipment are mostly equipped with external hous ing and an electric motor integrated into the fan hub this compact design allows space saving accommodation of all devices the flange is equipped with mounting holes diagonal fans high flow rate at relatively high pressure build up at first glance diagonal fans only differ slightly from axial fans intake is axial whereas exhaust is diagonal due to the conical shape of the wheel and housing the air is pressurised more in direct comparison with axial fans of the same size and comparable performance these fans are distinguished by the lower operating noise at high pressures centrifugal fans high pressure build up at limited flow rate many of the cooling problems that occur can be optimally solved by axial and or diagonal fans if for example the required cooling air has to be conducted at an angle of or if even high pressure is necessary centrifugal fans are more effective for your application ebm papst offers not only complete centrifugal fans but also motor impeller combinations without external housing tangential fans high flow rate at low pressure tangential fans are used above all for large surface air flow in devices the air flows through the roller shaped impellers twice in the radial direction in the intake area from the outside to the inside and in the outflow area from the inside to the outside whirls form in the roller due to the vanes which guarantee a steady flow of air through the impeller read down from this point to obtain the required value for the cooling air flow the diagram is based on the following formula optimum operating range the required fan however must also be able to deliver a suitable static pressure increase δpf in order to force the cooling air through the device a fan must therefore be selected that provides the required air flow performance within its optimum operating range see also the air performance curves under technical data fan selection if the requirements of an application are ful filled by more than one fan the noise level space requirements economy and ambient conditions will assist in making the final choice v m h pv w δt k selecting the correct fan dissipated energy a large amount of the energy consumed by electrical and electronic devices is converted into heat in selecting the correct fan therefore it is important to determine the dissipated energy that must be remo ved the electrical power consumption of the unit to be cooled often represents a suitable value for this purpose permissible temperature rise the air flow which the selected fan is required to generate is deter mined by the dissipated energy and the permissible rise δt of the cooling air flow from entry to exit of the device to be cooled the max allowable δt depends greatly on the temperature sensitivity of the individual device components δt k means e g that the avera ge air flow leaving the device to be cooled may only be c warmer than the ambient temperature a large volume of air is required for this

fans specials acmaxx i maxx ac axial fans accessories representatives dc centrifugal fans ac centrifugal fans fan installation information on installation when a fan is operated for the first time in an application the user may have noticed that the flow rate in the device was lower than expected what is the reason for this the values stated in this catalogue were determined under optimum constant and comparable measurement conditions ideal mounting conditions under which free air intake and exhaust are present are seldom feasible in practice quite frequently the fans must be mounted in close proximity to other components or cabinet panels as a consequence the intake and exhaust currents may be restricted causing the air flow to diminish and the noise level to increase fans are particularly sensitive to obstructions which are positioned directly in front of the output cross section as they often cause an increase in tonal noise our advice the distance between the fan and adjacent components should be at least equal to the installation depth of the fan intake or exhaust side installation under ideal conditions the operating point is represented as the intersection between the fan and loss curves regardless of whether the fan is positioned at the air intake or exhaust side of the device in addition to ensuring the required flow rate several additional aspects must be considered for determining an appro priate fan concept the intake air currents of a fan are mainly laminar comprising nearly the entire suction area by contrast the exhaust air of a fan is generally turbulent while it flows on a pre ferred direction e g axial for an axial fan the turbulences of the exhaust intensify the heat transfer from components within the air cur rents so that mounting the fan at the air intake side of the device is recommended for cooling and heating mounting the fan at the device intake is also advantageous because the fan will not be subjected to the dissipated heat of the device therefore it operates at low ambient temperatures and has a higher life expectancy baffle multidirectional intake laminar currents unidirectional exhaust turbulent accident prevention the turning rotor and the high speeds that are sometimes involved mean that our fan products carry an inherent risk of injury they may only be operated after correct installation

load of the bear ings is reduced thus con siderably increasing the life expectancy of the fans protection class dc fans with sleeve and ball bearings are pow ered by class e insulated motors all ebm papst fans conform to the requirements of protection class ip fans conforming to ip and spe cial protection classes are also avail able voltage range many of our dc fans can be operated on volta ges that are up to lower and higher than their nominal voltage see voltage range in the technical tables this enables the air per formance to be adapted to the cooling require ments and allows the noise to be reduced even if the fan does not have a control input closed loop speed control and monitoring closed loop speed control and function monito ring are becoming increasingly important in many applications ebm papst offers many fans in the standard design with a control input and open collector speed signal s force the new s force fans with their extremely high blower capacity of up to m h and pressu re build up of up to pascals are capable of dealing with the extreme heat load if nee ded these fans can produce up to more output under full load and they work with a much broader delivery bandwidth than current models this makes them ideal for equipment and systems with a high density of compo nents thanks to intelligent motor features they can be individually adapted for any

conveniently located in the fan hub product life expectancy a distinctive feature of dc fan technology is the convincingly high product life expectancy thanks to the excellent efficiency of the brush less drives the thermal load of the bearings is reduced thus considerably increasing the life expectancy of the fans protection class dc fans with sleeve and ball bearings are pow ered by class e insulated motors all ebm papst fans conform to the requirements of protection class ip fans conforming to ip and spe cial protection classes are also available voltage range many of our dc fans can be operated on volta ges that are up to lower and higher than their nominal voltage see voltage range in the technical tables this enables the air per formance to be adapted to the cooling require ments and allows the noise to be reduced even if the fan does not have a control input closed loop speed control and monitoring closed loop speed control and function monito ring are becoming increasingly important in many applications ebm papst offers many fans in the standard design with a control input and open collector speed signal s force centrifugal radical the new s force centrifugal fans provide peak performance among fans of this type with air flow capacity at over m³ h and a pressure build up of up to pascals the highest heat flows are manageable in addition the models are extremely

specials acmaxx i maxx ac axial fans accessories representatives dc centrifugal fans ac centrifugal fans dc fans specials cooling capacity and efficiency greater power density increasing miniaturisation and extreme electronic component density are posing increased demands on the cooling capacity and efficiency of fans the intelligent and space saving integration of the fan in the device configuration is therefore of major importance tailor made cooling adapted to the situation as and when required programmable cooling by defining speed profiles transparency of function thanks to complete interactive monitoring in all operating conditions ebm papst provides intelligent cooling concepts which are optimally adapted to requirements for example speed adaptation via ntc sensor standard fans in electronics cooling tried and tested by the millions and nevertheless a temporary solution because standard fans have a distinct disadvantage with constant speed and a corresponding high noise factor they continuously provide the air flow required in extreme cases this extreme case only occurs if it occurs at all for a fraction of the service life what is needed is an intelligent fan that automatically adapts to the current cooling requirements the ebm papst answer a complete range of dc fans with temperature controlled speed adapta tion in all standard dimensions installation is simple the control electronics receive their thermal information for speed adaptation steplessly and loss free via a tem perature sensor either externally via a single lead positioned as required or internally direct ly in the fan hub in the air flow dc fans with separate control input open or closed loop speed control is also possi ble with dc fans that have a separate control input a variation in speed can thus be imple mented via a control voltage or a pulse width modulated signal these possibilities are used primarily in devices that have appropriate stan dard interfaces and thus require a load depend ent variation of the fans technical information dc fans specials a pwm sensor signal dc fans with sensor signal the integrated electronic tachometer continu ously provides an actual speed signal for exter nal evaluation the user is informed at all times of the current fan speed via an extremely sim ple signal evaluation on the customer side the sensor signal is via a separate lead alarm signal for applications which require monitored fan operation with alarm signal ebm papst has numerous alarm signal versions either a static pre processed or interface compatible high or low continuous signal depending on the type of fan turbo drives fans with three phase ec drives and micro processor controlled motor electronics these three phase motors whose torque is virtually non reliant on the rotor position are used for extremely high running smoothness the speed of these fans can be controlled over a very wide range with pwm analogue voltage or tempera ture optionally the fans can be supplied with reversible direction of rotation and active brake operation vario pro fans this high end fan concept by ebmpapst with pro grammed intelligence and customer specific inte grated functions makes your electronics cooling even more versatile and competitive vario pro ensures a fresh economic breeze for all demanding cooling tasks e g where greater reliability more flexibility and intelligent function features such as alarm function speed control etc are required the successful concept of vario pro is tailor made software instead of fixed hardware because pro grammed software modules for motor control and application intelligence are responsible for the work that analogue components were responsible for in the past this central control unit of the vario pro comprises a microcontroller and an eeprom on which all characteristics are stored protection against environmental influences some applications place particular demands on the fans resistance to ambient influences such as dust moisture water and salt ebm papst offer solutions for adapting fans to these ambient condi tions technical information information dc axial fans dc

acmaxx i maxx progress made by ebm papst the best example the acmaxx fans from ebm papst which thanks to an ingenious yet simple improvement over conventional ac fans provide substantial benefits the aim in developing the new acmaxx series was to raise the technology standard of the conventional ac fan significantly and in the process facil itate the transition to the new technology by retaining the overall mount ing dimensions in short to ensure the fans can be replaced without any peripheral changes or changes to the voltage situation ebm papst offers two generations of acmaxx products that meet different needs long service life the efficiency of acmaxx and i maxx motors is up to higher than that of conventional ac fan variants this not only saves energy it also means less intrinsic heating in the motor the reduced heating has a direct positi ve effect on the bearing system which is why the fans have a service life that is up to longer this also lengthens the service and maintenance intervals significantly the expense of replacement fans and even more expensive downtimes are kept to a manageable minimum technical information ac standard service life acmaxx increase in life time h what acmaxx and i maxx have in common energy efficiency the drive concept is based on state of the art greentech ec technology with outstanding motor efficiency compared to ac fans of the same size acmaxx energy consumption is up to lower for higher cooling capa city the energy balance alone means that the products pay for themsel ves after only a few months the savings over the entire service life espe cially in systems with multiple fans is considerable eur years ac n ac aci independent of mains frequency and mains voltage the acmaxx and i maxx fans are prepared for direct connection to all ac voltages and frequencies the speed and thus important properties of the fan such as air flow and noise are independent of the power frequency and do not change even within the

series boasts energy savings of almost compared to the corresponding ac fan thus providing signi ficantly higher savings than the level of the old ac generation ac n ac aci saving use saving use use i maxx is quieter the i maxx aci is quieter quieter than ac fans and quieter than the existing acmaxx generation the reason for this is the optimised aerody namics and the drive which is optimised for minimum structure borne noise thus the fan is only half as loud at comparable air performance and is up to db a quieter at some operating points speed independent of voltage and frequency for the i

is not available the ac range of fans is based on experience gained from decades of development activity millions of units in series production and competence in innovation of a world wide technological leader a wide range of fans for ac operation is pre sented in this catalogue in addition to complete device fans you will also find fans without external housing providing a particularly eco nomical advantage when the air duct can be integrated in the respective device variety of sizes ac fans are available in a variety of sizes with either air exhaust or air intake over struts silent running models with sleeve bearings or for extreme ambient conditions fans with ball bearings are available with plug connection or external leads shaded pole or capacitor motors fan drives by shaded pole or capacitor motors most of which incorporate the world famous ebm papst external rotor principle the fan blades are directly attached to the external rotor of the external rotor motor thus combining both high performance and profitability flat built ac fans ebm papst also has particularly flat built ac fans with internal rotor motor their advantage quick start to full speed a plastic impeller and the both smaller and lighter internal rotor motor lead to a lower moment of inertia bearings ac fans with sleeve bearings are powered by class e insulated motors fans with ball bearings are equipped with class b e or f insulated motors protection class all ebm papst fans conform to the requirements of ip fans conforming to ip and special types of protection class are also available ac voltage the line of ac fans for euro voltage according to iec v is basically also available for v frequencies ac fans can be operated at frequencies of hz or hz however their technical data then change accordingly capacitor fans driven by capacitor external motors provide particularly high operating efficiency generally the required operating capacitor is already integrated in the fan housing overloading almost all ac fans are protected against over loading e g due to locked rotor the drive motors are either impedance protected marked impedance protected and or z p or are equipped with a

around the world is sure to be near to you compact fans for ac dc and ec edition information axial fans high air flow with medium to relatively high pressure increase the air flow in axial fans with an impeller that is similar to a propeller is conducted largely parallel to the axis of rotation in other words in the axial direction axial fans with free air delivery at zero static pressure have the lowest power input that rises with increasing back pressure axial fans for cooling of electronic equipment are mostly equipped with external housing the electric motor is integrated in the fan hub this compact design allows space saving accommodation of all devices the flange is equipped with mounting holes diagonal fans high air flow at relatively high pressure increase at first glance diagonal fans only differ slightly from axial fans intake is axial whereas exhaust is diagonal due to the conical shape of the wheel and housing the air is pressurized more in the diagonal fan in direct comparison with axial fans of the same size and comparable performance these fans are distinguished by the lower operating noise at high pressures centrifugal fans high pressure increase at limited flow rate generally many cooling tasks can be performed excellently by axial and or diagonal fans but if the cooling airflow has to be deflected at an angle of for example or if even greater pressure increase is necessary centrifugal fans are more effective for your application ebm papst offers not only complete centrifugal fans but also motor impeller combinations without external housing tangential fans high air flow with low pressure increase tangential fans are used especially to produce a wide airflow distribution through devices the air flows through the roller shaped impellers twice in the centrifugal direction in the intake area from the outside to the inside and in the outflow area from the inside to the outside whirls form in the roller due to the vanes which guarantee a steady flow of air through the impeller types of fans and their function compact fans for ac dc and ec edition drive know how for the past years all conceivable types and applications of drive engineering have played an essential role at ebm papst a commitment that is the foundation for the development of optimum drive solutions regardless of the type of fan and its use in dc fans ebm papst set standards years ago with the intro duction of dc fans with electronically commutated external rotor motors in the changeover from ac fans to ec motors ebm papst is again doing pioneering work ec motors for ac connection are highly efficient and impress with their long service life higher air flow and significant pressure increase smooth operation our aerodynamically optimized design and high mechanical preci sion produces outstanding noise properties in series production the soft commutation electronics of dc and ec fans produce a very smooth operation by avoiding steep switching edges when the individual coils are switched this reduces the structure borne noise from the motor computer aided measurements and series of analyses performed in a state of the art sound measuring chamber are conducted on each fan model from the very beginning long service life the bearing system plays a vital role both in the long service life and the smooth operation of device fans the sintec compact bearing provides most of the device fans with a proven bearing system constant low noise during the entire operating time and considerably lower shock sensitivity are the outstanding features of this bearing technology in addition with regard to temperature endurance sintec compact bearings can be used without problems in most applications despite the slightly greater noise and shock sensitivity of ball bea rings this bearing technology should be given preference for fans exposed to extreme thermal and adverse application conditions e g extreme environmental conditions critical

dissipated energy a large amount of the energy consumed by electrical and electronic devices is converted to heat so when selecting the correct fan it is important to determine the dissipated energy that must be removed the electrical power consumption of the unit to be cooled often represents a suitable value for this purpose admissible temperature increase the air flow that the selected fan is required to generate is deter mined by the dissipated energy and the admissible heating δt of the cooling airflow from entry to exit of the device to be cooled the maximum admissible δt depends greatly on the temperature sensitivity of the individual parts of the device for example δt k means that the average cooling airflow leaving the device to be cooled may be only c warmer than the ambient temperature this requires a lot of air a lower air flow rate is sufficient if a higher temperature difference e g δt k can be tolerated required cooling airflow in the diagram below a horizontal line is drawn from the dissipated energy to intersect with the selected δt line read down from this point to obtain the required value for the cooling airflow the diagram is based on the following formula fan selection but the fan you are looking for must also be able to deliver a suit able static pressure increase δpf in order to force the cooling air through the device so a fan must be selected that provides the required air flow performance within its operating range see also the air performance curves under technical data fan selection with multiple alternatives if more than

the correct fan compact fans for ac dc and ec edition intake or exhaust side installation under ideal conditions the operating point is represented as the intersection between the fan and loss curves regardless of whether the fan is positioned at the air intake or exhaust side of the device in addition to ensuring the required flow rate several other aspects must be considered for determining an appropriate fan concept the intake air currents of a fan are mainly laminar comprising nearly the entire suction area by contrast the exhaust air of a fan is generally turbulent and flows in a preferred direction such as axial for an axial fan the turbulence of the exhaust intensifies the heat transfer from components within the air currents so that installing the fan on the air intake side of the device is recommen ded for cooling and heating installing the fan at the device intake is also advantageous because the fan will not be subjected to the dissipated heat of the device therefore it operates at low ambient temperatures and has a greater life expectancy information on installation when a fan is operated for the first time in an application the user may have noticed that the air flow in the device was lower than expected what is the reason for this the values stated in this catalog were determined under optimum constant and comparable measurement conditions due to manufacturing tolerances both the speed of the drive motor and the geometric shape of the fan impeller are usually not exactly the nominal values but within defined tolerance ranges ideal installation conditions under which free air intake and exhaust are present are seldom feasible in practice quite frequently the fans have to be installed in close proximity to other components or cabinet panels as a consequence the intake and exhaust currents may be restricted causing the air flow to diminish and the sound level to increase fans are particularly sensitive to obstructions that are positioned directly in front of the output cross section and they often cause an increase in tonal noise our advice the distance between the fan and adjacent compo nents should be at least equal to the installation depth of the fan information fan installation accident prevention the turning rotor and the high speeds that are so metimes involved mean that our fan products carry an inherent risk of

integration of the fan in the device configuration is very important tailor made cooling adapted to the situation as and when required programmable cooling by defining speed profiles transparency of function thanks to complete interactive monitoring in all operating conditions standard fans in electronics cooling have proven themselves a million times over with a constant speed and an appropriate sound level they continuously provide the air flow required for extreme cases but these extreme situations occur seldom if at all during operation what is needed is an intelligent fan that adapts auto matically to the level of cooling required at the time ebm papst provides intelligent cooling concepts that are optimally adapted to practical requirements for example speed adjustment via temperature sensor ebm papst answers with a complete range of dc fans with temperaturecontrolled speed adjustment via a temperature sensor available in a variety of standard dimensions installation is very simple either an external temperature sensor in the form of an exposed wire that can be placed anywhere or an internal sensor located directly in the fan hub in the air flow provides continuous and undissipated thermal information to the control electronics for speed adjustment a range of temperature sensors can be found on page dc fans with separate control input open or closed loop speed control is also possible with dc fans that have a separate control input so a control voltage or a pulse width modulated signal can be used to vary the speed these options are used primarily in devices that have the appropriate standard interfaces and require varied fans depending on the load compact fans for ac dc and ec edition technical information dc fans specials speed signal dc fans with speed signal the integrated electronic tachometer continuously provides an actual speed signal for external evaluation a very simple signal evaluation on the customer side informs the user of the current fan speed at all times the speed signal is provided by a separate wire alarm signal for applications that require monitored fan operation with an alarm signal ebm papst offers a number of alarm signals variants depending on the type of fan in question the signal will either be static already evaluated or a continuous interface compatible high or low signal the alarm signal is provided by a separate wire powerful greentech motor fans with three phase ec drives and microprocessor controlled motor electronics the torque of these three phase motors which is virtually independent of the rotor position allows the fan to run very smoothly the speed of these fans can be controlled over a very wide speed range by means of pwm analog voltage or temperature optionally the fans can be

means of a complex algorithm calculate the remaining service life for each individual fan functionality end of life indication output via alarm pwm analog or digital signal it equipment such as servers routers and in row cooling applications must be operational for this reason maintenance work is often carried out during operation if a single fan or a plug in unit with several fans is taken out of service for this purpose this can create a tricky situation the remaining fans must provide adequate air flow as a result of this and the back pressure of appli cations air flows through the fan taken out of service and it is driven by an external source as with a wind turbine the problem is that when driven by an external source these speeds can amount to several thousand revolutions per

application in the worst case scenario in sound wave form these are considered disruptive in the development phase this structure borne noise is difficult to predict and varies from application to application our aim is to develop motors with as little structure borne noise as possible so that this problem does not occur in the first place with our axiaci motor technology we have succeeded if we look at the sum of the acceleration levels acmaxx and ac n are comparable however axiaci has a noticeable lower base level and also significantly lower peaks during accele ration amplitudes and therefore its structure borne noise is much less intrusive as a result it also offers noise benefits for sensitive applications ac standard ac maxx axiaci m s greentech ec axial fans greentech ec axial fans compact fans for ac dc and ec edition cost optimization lower energy costs due to greater efficiency a drive concept based on state of the art greentech ec tech nology with outstanding motor efficiency level the energy consumption is up to lower than in ac fans of the same size the energy savings alone mean that the products pay for them selves after only a few months the savings made over the entire service life especially in systems with multiple fans are worth it reduction in logistics costs as independent from line frequency and line voltage the greentech ec axial compact fans are prepared for direct connection to all ac voltages and frequencies thanks to the wide voltage capability of the fan a certain speed version can be operated worldwide regardless of the vac or vac power supply voltage and frequency fluctuations during the power supply operation are compensated automatically this reduces logistics costs and makes warehousing easier long service life the efficiency of greentech ec axial compact fans is up to greater than that of conventional ac fans this not only saves energy it also means that the motor heats itself up less the bearing system in particular responds positively to heating itself up less the reason why the fans have a service life that is up to longer this also extends the service and maintenance intervals significantly investments in replacement fans and down times which are even more expensive remain small enough to manage higher performance unlike conventional ac technology the state of the art drive concept of this fan series is not linked to a fixed power frequency this allows the motor speed to be increased over a wide range this enables significantly higher air flow rates and significant pressure increases flexibility and countless possible uses ip provides protection against harmful environmental influences and harsh operating conditions natural refrigerant no problem safety approvals according to din en din en enable use with natural explosive refrigerants everything is possible from standby mode overload mode at peak times or night reduction to temperature controlled quiet operation from speed monitoring to long term function monitoring via alarm or speed signal the fans offer optional interfaces that allow easy and quick implementation of opera tional monitoring

available in addition to complete devices you will also find fans without external housing these offer econo mic benefits whenever the air duct design can be integrated in the device that is being ventilated ac centrifugal fans are available in many sizes with forward or backward curved fan impeller depending on the installation situation it is a pure fan impeller or is combined with a housing with optimized air flow and noise fan drives through shaded pole or capacitor motors usually incorporate the familiar external rotor principle this design combines high performance with economic efficiency ebm papst also offers particularly flat ac fans with an internal rotor motor the advantage of these is their fast start up to full speed resulting in lower mass moments of inertia all fan

turning into new industrial standards this competitive capability can only be maintained by seeing ventilation as a whole the interrelationship between and thus the system of motor engineering aerodynamics and electronics these are our three core competencies imminently connected and linked in each of our products and so we handle air intelligently and quietly and continue to set new standards in drive technology our system solutions form the main part of our product range by now and they will be our main key to success motor engineering aerodynamics electronics our drive is well known and famous with specialists our external rotor motor which has made us world market leader quietly yet powerfully being versatile as to integration it is ideally suited to the most diverse applications based on this principle we here at ebm papst have devel oped the widest range of fans and motor types in the world and for hot or aggressive blower mediums the internal rotor motor is the perfect complement still in drive engineering certain applications simply require the internal rotor motor principle and they are then realised with our motors specifi cally developed for such cases take for instance the steering support motor in the automotive field developed as innovation in active steering be it axial or centrifugal fans centrifugal blowers compact fans or tangential blowers we always design fan blades impeller blades and ducted housings with the specific application in mind we strive to minimise noise and to optimise efficiency this is the challenge that we have taken up and which we meet working away powerfully and quietly finally intelligence will become the decisive factor on all markets in future after all only in connection with electronics can drive and air flow as a system solution have an optimal effect in a product or application interfaces are avoided and thus potential faults and failures setting new standards with ec technology wherever intelligent air handling is required where energy consumption needs to be reduced and performance has to be maximised there our ec motors are your reliable answer they do not waste financial or natural resources

measurement conditions for air and noise measurement ebm papst products are measured under the following conditions axial and centrifugal fans with direction of air flow v without guard grille and in the wall ring backward curved centrifugal fans free running and with inlet nozzle forward curved single and dual inlet centrifugal fans with housing noise measurements all noise measurements are carried out in low reflective test rooms with reverberant floor thus the ebm papst acoustic test chambers meet the requirements of precision class according to din en iso for noise measurement the fans being tested are placed in a reverberant wall and operated at nominal voltage for ac also at nominal frequency without additional attachments such as the guard grille sound pressure level and sound level all noise levels are measured in conformity to din and iso according to precision class and specified a weighted when the sound pressure level lp is measured the microphone is on the intake side of the fan being tested usually at a distance of m on the fan axis to measure the sound level lw microphones are distributed over an enveloping surface on the intake side of the fan being

systems accessories technology contacts adding multiple noise sources with the same level adding noise sources with the same volume results in a level increase of approx db the noise characteristics of multiple identical fans can be determined in advance based on the noise values specified in the data sheet this is shown in the diagram opposite example ag axial fans are on a condenser according to the data sheet the sound pressure level of a fan is approximately db a the level increase measured from the diagram is db thus the overall sound level of the installation can be expected to be db a adding two noise sources with different levels the acoustic performance of two different fans can be predetermined based on the sound levels given in the data sheet this is shown in the diagram opposite example there is an axial fan ag with a sound pressure level of db a at the operating point and an axial fan ag with db a in a ventilation unit the level difference is db the level increase can now be read in the diagram as approx db this means that the overall sound level of the unit can be expected to be db a inverse square laws the sound level is independent of the distance from the noise source conversely the sound pressure level decreases as distance from the noise source increases the diagram to the right shows the level decrease expressed in terms of an output measurement at a distance of m from the noise source under far field conditions example an axial fan ag has a sound pressure level of db a at the operating point now you want to measure the noise characteristics at a distance of m in the diagram to the right you can now read a reduction of db for the m distance db number of sources of sound with identical level increase in sound pressure sound power level db db

builds cables to our exacting standards for a variety of applications considerations for cable selection cable design description typical applications shielded twisted pair shielded twisted pair wire permanent sensor installations most often use wire shielded cable because it minimizes electrical noise including rfi esd and emi and is compatible with standard wire sensors multi conductor shielded shielded twisted wire for use with or conductors multi conductor shielded cable is used with or conductor sensors because it minimizes electrical noise coaxial carries power and signal on an inner conductor the shield acts as the signal common coaxial cable is used with bnc connectors and charge output accelerometers low noise mineral insulation cable minimizes triboelectric effects shielding description typical applications foil shielding made of aluminized mylar with a drain wire for electrical connection the foil blocks high levels of rf signal which are often found in wind turbine nacelles or high speed turbines braided or spiral shielding is provided by a braid made from many strands of small gauge wire and wrapped around the conductor s of a cable braided shielding is considered more effective at minimizing power line frequencies found around electric motors tightly wound braided shield also protects against rf interference industrial process predictive maintenance condition monitoring military specifications hazardous areas test measurement transportation underwater paper machines machine tools high temperature radiation resistant maritime info wilcoxon com wilcoxon com buy wilcoxon com selecting the right cable assembly for a sensor is highly dependent on factors in the environment in which the sensor will operate it s important to consider the application and the environment to ensure data reliability an applications support specialist can help you determine the cable protection level and connector fittings that meet your needs custom cable orders are usually built in less than a week and many standard cables ship the next day all cable assemblies are built with care and precision to ensure the quality you ve come to expect from wilcoxon maxflex cables cable protection description typical applications spiral armored jacket spiral wrap interleaved band of metal surrounding a cable the spiral armored jacket protects the cable from heavy objects such as those found in a hot roll steel mill and provides chemical resistance due to the cable s complete isolation from the atmosphere stainless steel overbraid braided electrical shield of stainless steel wrapped along the outside of a cable a stainless steel overbraid protects the cable from sharp objects and can act as an additional signal shield for underwater applications the braid protects the outer insulation from foreign objects and does not trap water environmental resistance description typical applications teflon best temperature resistance excellent chemical resistance the cable jacket of choice for most applications teflon can withstand temperatures up to c making it ideal for high temperature environments teflon is resistant to most chemicals and physically strong providing long cable life enviroprene better chemical resistance in non abrasive environments a low cost alternative to teflon enviroprene is useful for most environments and protects against common exposures such as uv rays found in outdoor cable tray installations pvc good chemical resistance pvc is a low cost solution for dry air installations but does not provide the same range of chemical resistances as teflon tefzel better chemical resistance rated for use in areas where radiation is present radiation resistance makes tefzel appropriate for use in nuclear environments polyurethane low cost waterproof material with good abrasion resistance polyurethane is often used in underwater applications because it can be bonded to metals creating a watertight seal to the sensor info wilcoxon com wilcoxon com buy wilcoxon com maxflex cables for data collectors are designed for high performance in the harsh environments of route based data collection with reinforced cable joints at the sensor connector end the most common point of failure for similar cables due to severe handling maxflex cables are reliable durable and resistant to wear and tear they are also compatible with data collectors made by skf emerson csi rockwell entek ird and ge commtest extended life reinforced for strength and maximum flexibility pull tested to over pounds excellent emi rfi shielding why maxflex
